1. I implemented a marker for myself, shown by a unique icon (a cat), markers 
   for other people in the JSON file (a golden retriever puppy), and markers
   for landmarks (pawprints). These were all displayed on a map using the 
   Google Maps API, which I got running by getting my own API key. Upon being 
   clicked, details of the marker are displayed, and the details are gotten 
   from the parsed JSON file. The program receives the file through a post
   request after sending my login and my coordinates. When the map and markers
   are displayed, the map also displays a red polyline from my marker to the
   nearest landmark. Only landmarks a mile away or less from me are displayed.

2. I discussed this assignment with Martin Gao (he clarified what async was and
   how functions in JavaScript work) and Thu Cao (we just discussed the projec
   broadly).

3. I spent about 15 hours on this assignment.
