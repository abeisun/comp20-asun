  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  	<p>I was hired to find at least three security vulnerabilities in another
  	student's web application</p>
  <h1>Methodology</h1>
  	<p>To test for Cross Site Scripting vulnerabilities, I used curl to inject
  	JavaScript as a request parameter to see if the browser would run it.</p>
  	<p>I also tested to see if, using the MongoDB not equal operator ($ne), /checkin.json 
  	would send all the information of the users with a login not equal to the input
  	(for example, if I typed https://lit-falls-27393.herokuapp.com/checkins.json?login[$ne]=angela
  	into my browser, the web app would send all the information of users who do not have the
  	login "angela", which poses a security risk, as that information includes the location
  	of those people.</p>
  	<p>I could test for those vulnerabilities without looking at my partner's code and using
  	curl or a browser. To find the rest of the flaws in my partner's code, I read the code itself.</p>
  <h1>Abstract of Findings</h1>
  	<p>When I injected the line
  	"&ltscript&gtwindow.location.replace('http://stackoverflow.com');&lt/script&gt" 
  	as my login, the page redirected to .</p>
  	<p>I also tested to see if, using the MongoDB not equal operator ($ne), /checkin.json 
  	would send all the information of the users with a login not equal to the input
  	(for example, if I typed https://lit-falls-27393.herokuapp.com/checkins.json?login[$ne]=angela
  	into my browser, the web app would send all the information of users who do not have the
  	login "angela", which poses a security risk, as that information includes the location
  	of those people.</p>
  	<p>Finally, by looking at my partner's code, I saw that using POST for /sendLocation, there's
  	the line "response.header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*");" The "*" asterisk means that
  	anyone could access /sendLocation.</p>
