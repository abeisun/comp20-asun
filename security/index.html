  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  	<p>I was hired to find at least three security vulnerabilities in another
  	student's web application</p>
  <h1>Methodology</h1>
  	<p>To test for Cross Site Scripting vulnerabilities, I used curl to inject
  	JavaScript as a request parameter to see if the browser would run it.</p>
  	<p>I also tested to see if there was any security in place to maintain privacy. I used the
  	MongoDB not equal ($ne) operator as one way of testing for this</p>
  	<p>I could test for those vulnerabilities without looking at my partner's code and using
  	curl or a browser. To find the rest of the flaws in my partner's code, I read the code itself.</p>
  <h1>Abstract of Findings</h1>
  	<p>When I injected the line
  	"&ltscript&gtwindow.location.replace('http://stackoverflow.com');&lt/script&gt" 
  	as my login, the page redirected to stackoverflow.com.</p>
  	<p>I also tested to see if, using the MongoDB not equal operator ($ne), /checkin.json 
  	would send all the information of the users with a login not equal to the input
  	(for example, if I typed https://lit-falls-27393.herokuapp.com/checkins.json?login[$ne]=angela
  	into my browser, the web app would send all the information of users who do not have the
  	login "angela", which poses a security risk, as that information includes the location
  	of those people.</p>
  	<p>Finally, by looking at my partner's code, I saw that using POST for /sendLocation, there's
  	the line "response.header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*");" The "*" asterisk means that
  	anyone could access /sendLocation.</p>
  	<p>Also, I realized that there was no protection that prevented others from overloading the 
  	server using echo curl..., which means it would be possible to add a lot of junk data, go
  	over the memory limit (which could just mean that the person's credit card would be charged),
  	or maybe the server couldn't handle the number</p>
   <h1>Issues found</h1>
	   <p>The cross site scripting issue occurs because the user is allowed to enter anything
	   for the login, including JavaScript, because this web app trusts user data and
	   does not strip it of certain characters. This occurs on heroku.com/sendLocation. This
	   is a high severity issue because someone could easily inject JavaScript that redirects
	   to another page. The user could be unaware of this and enter in private information, which
	   would give sensitive data to a hacker.</p>
