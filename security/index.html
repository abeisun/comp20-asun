  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  	<p>I was hired to find at least three security vulnerabilities in another
  	student's web application.</p>
  <h1>Methodology</h1>
  	<p>To test for Cross Site Scripting vulnerabilities, I used curl to inject
  	JavaScript as a request parameter to see if the browser would run it.</p>
  	<p>I also tested to see if there was any security in place to maintain privacy. I used the
  	I tested to see if a noSQL injection was possible with the MongoDB not equal ($ne) operator
  	as one way of testing for this</p>
  	<p>I could test for those vulnerabilities without looking at my partner's code and using
  	curl or a browser. To find the rest of the flaws in my partner's code, I read the code itself.</p>
  <h1>Abstract of Findings</h1>
  	<p>When I injected the line
  	"&ltscript&gtwindow.location.replace('http://stackoverflow.com');&lt/script&gt" 
  	as my login, the page redirected to stackoverflow.com.</p>
  	<p>I found that I could easily access the login and location of other users by using my 
  	browser and typing in /checkin.json?login[$ne]=username. The page then printed out the 
  	information of every other user that did not have the login "username," which is a severe
  	privacy issue.</p>
  	<p>Finally, by looking at my partner's code, I saw that using POST for /sendLocation, there's
  	the line "response.header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*");" The "*" asterisk means that
  	anyone could access /sendLocation.</p>
  	<p>Also, I realized that there was no protection that prevented others from overloading the 
  	server using echo curl..., which means it would be possible to add a lot of junk data, go
  	over the memory limit (which could just mean that the person's credit card would be charged),
  	or maybe the server couldn't handle the number</p>
   <h1>Issues found</h1>
	   <p>The cross site scripting issue occurs because the user is allowed to enter anything
	   for the login, including JavaScript, because this web app trusts user data and
	   does not strip it of certain characters. This occurs on heroku.com/sendLocation. This
	   is a high severity issue because someone could easily inject JavaScript that redirects
	   to another page. The user could be unaware of this and enter in private information, which
	   would give sensitive data to a hacker.</p>

	   <p>I also tested to see if, using the MongoDB not equal operator ($ne), /checkin.json 
		would send all the information of the users with a login not equal to the input
	  	(for example, if I typed https://lit-falls-27393.herokuapp.com/checkins.json?login[$ne]=angela
	  	into my browser, the web app would send all the information of users who do not have the
	  	login "angela", which poses a security risk, as that information includes the location
	  	of those people. This risk is severe as well. Not only cou</p>
	  <img src="Mongo_ne_example.png" alt="Proof of Mongo not equal operator vulnerability">
	  <p>A way to fix this is using mongo-sanitize, which would strip out any keys starting with "$." 
	  Also, using Mongoose would solve the problem, as it automatically converts passed in objects to 
	  strings.

	 	<p>Finally, I found the issue of allowing Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS), which allows
	 	any site to make a request. This wouldn't be a security issue if it weren't for the fact that
	 	the site stores information that should be private, such as login and location. Because 
	 	this site is designed to allow access to /sendLocation only by using XHR requests, there is
	 	no need for CORS, and especially if there is verification involved, the websote could be
	 	vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery. This is a severe vulnerability because this
	 	allows a third party to act as a user and target state-change requests. </p>
	  <img src="cors.png" alt="stackoverflow explanation of CORS and its security risks">
	  <p> This could be solved, at least from what I've researched, by having the user send a preflighted 
	  request, as this web app takes POST requests from the user. The client-side sends POST request that
	  includes a login and location, and the server authenticates it.
