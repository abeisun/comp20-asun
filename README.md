1. The purpose of this Git repository is to upload assignments for this class and eventually for us
   to have a place to keep and display our projects to the public.
2. My favorite lab or assignment was assignment 4, as I finally learned how it is possible to hack
   a website (and how to implement basic security techniques).
3. I can now create a website and server (after referencing some outside sources), and I now know the
   value of web programming and security, which is more than I could say after only coming in with 
   comp 11 experience.
4. The most important thing I learned in this course is that using code you do not understand is 
   dangerous and not to do it. For example, implementing assignment 3 without knowing what the code
   is not a good idea. Not only would it be impossible to debug when the site won't load but also
   when it came to security, you wouldn't know, for example, how XSS occurs or why adding 
   response.header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*") creates a vulnerability (I definitely didn't).
   Furthermore, if you did that for assignment 2, when doing assignment 3, it would be difficult 
   figuring out how to connect the client-side to the server not knowing what the lines of code do.
5. I would like to delve deeper into security and how to keep data secure, and why every so often, we
   hear of big companies having giant security breaches when us as consumers trust them with our data.
